# Persona-Driven Document Intelligence Approach

## Overview
This system implements a persona-driven document intelligence solution that extracts and prioritizes relevant content from PDF collections based on user personas and specific job requirements.

## Architecture

### 1. Document Processing Layer
- **PDF Text Extraction**: Uses PyPDF2 for robust PDF text extraction with error handling
- **Content Structuring**: Automatically identifies sections and subsections within documents
- **Text Cleaning**: Removes artifacts and normalizes text for consistent processing

### 2. Persona Analysis Engine
- **Keyword Mapping**: Maps personas to relevant domain keywords using predefined vocabularies
- **Context Understanding**: Analyzes job-to-be-done tasks to extract additional relevant terms
- **Relevance Scoring**: Combines keyword matching, content length, and structural indicators

### 3. Section Ranking Algorithm
- **Multi-factor Scoring**: Weights keyword relevance (60%), content length (20%), and structure (20%)
- **Persona Alignment**: Prioritizes sections that align with persona expertise and job requirements
- **Dynamic Ranking**: Adapts to different document types and user contexts

### 4. Content Extraction & Refinement
- **Intelligent Truncation**: Maintains sentence boundaries while respecting length constraints
- **Context Preservation**: Ensures extracted subsections retain meaningful context
- **Quality Filtering**: Removes low-quality or irrelevant content fragments

## Key Features

### Persona-Specific Processing
- Travel Planner: Focuses on destinations, activities, accommodations, and logistics
- HR Professional: Emphasizes forms, processes, compliance, and documentation
- Food Contractor: Prioritizes recipes, ingredients, preparation, and menu planning
- Researcher: Targets methodology, analysis, findings, and academic content

### Adaptive Content Analysis
- Recognizes structured content (lists, numbered items, headings)
- Adjusts relevance scoring based on content organization
- Handles diverse document formats and layouts

### Output Optimization
- Standardized JSON format for consistent integration
- Metadata tracking for audit trails and processing insights
- Configurable section limits to meet performance constraints

## Performance Characteristics
- CPU-only processing for broad compatibility
- Sub-60 second processing for 3-5 document collections
- Memory-efficient streaming for large documents
- Scalable architecture supporting multiple personas and domains

## Quality Assurance
- Content validation ensures meaningful extracted sections
- Duplicate detection prevents redundant results  
- Length constraints maintain output consistency
- Error handling provides graceful failure recovery
